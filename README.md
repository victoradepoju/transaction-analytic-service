# Transaction Analytics Project

This project is a Java (Spring Boot) application designed to analyze transaction data from files stored in a folder. It provides various endpoints to calculate metrics such as the highest sales volume in a day, the highest sales value in a day, the most sold product by volume, the highest sales staff by month, and the highest hour of the day by average transaction volume.

## Project Overview

The project is built using **Spring Boot** and provides a REST API to analyze transaction data. The data is stored in files, where each file represents transactions for a specific day. The application reads these files, processes the data, and provides insights through various endpoints.

### Key Features:
- **Highest Sales Volume in a Day**: Calculates the highest total sales volume across all days.
- **Highest Sales Value in a Day**: Finds the highest individual sales value across all days.
- **Most Sold Product by Volume**: Determines the product ID with the highest total quantity sold.
- **Highest Sales Staff by Month**: Identifies the staff ID with the highest total sales volume for each month.
- **Highest Hour by Average Transaction Volume**: Finds the hour of the day with the highest average transaction volume.

## Running the Project

### Folder Structure for Transaction Files

Place your transaction files in a folder. Each file should represent transactions for a specific day. The files should be in the following format:

```
<transactionId>,<timestamp>,<items>,<saleAmount>
```

Example:
```
1,2025-01-01T12:40:45,[857749:6|804084:5|505009:2],5676.010
2,2025-01-01T09:17:54,[865779:1|10792:9|471499:8],39642.009
```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application using the command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

2. Use a tool like **Postman** or **cURL** to interact with the API.

## Example Usage

### Using cURL

For easy testing, a list of transaction files is already provided in the `src/main/resources/transactions` folder of the Spring application. You can use the following absolute path for testing on a Mac (uses appropriate absolute path for windows):

```
/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions
```

If you want to use your own transaction files, ensure you provide the absolute path to the folder containing the files.

1. **Analyze Transactions**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/analyze-transactions?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```

2. **Highest Sales Volume in a Day**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/highest-sales-volume?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```

3. **Highest Sales Value in a Day**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/highest-sales-value?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```

4. **Most Sold Product by Volume**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/most-sold-product?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```

5. **Highest Sales Staff by Month**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/highest-sales-staff-by-month?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```

6. **Highest Hour by Average Transaction Volume**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/transaction-analysis/highest-hour-by-average-volume?folderPath=/Users/username/your-project-folder/transaction-analytic/src/main/resources/transactions"
   ```
